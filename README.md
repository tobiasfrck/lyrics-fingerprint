# lyrics-fingerprint / lyrical fingerprint

## What is this?
This processing sketch creates a fingerprint for lyrics.

## How does it work?
This sketch creates a diagram where on the X-axis and Y-axis are the lyrics of a song or any other text.
Everytime x and y are the same word, the sketch draws a dot.
This is how to make a fingerprint or self-similarity matrix of a song lyric or text.
A very good example is the web-version I linked [here](#inspiration).
Then this sketchs filters some special characters, cleans up the image, adds colors and adds some blur to make it look pretty.

## Example
### Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley
